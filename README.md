This tool is designed to automatically monitor changes (such as file creation, modification, or deletion) within a specified source directory and replicate these changes to a target directory in real time or whenever connection is established. It leverages the Linux inotify API to efficiently detect file system events without polling, ensuring minimal resource usage and fast response times.
